# Migration Summary: Google Forms ‚Üí Google Apps Script

## What Changed

All form submissions have been migrated from Google Forms to a custom Google Apps Script backend. This provides better control, separation of concerns, and professional email notifications.

## Files Created

### 1. **Backend Script**
- `google-apps-script/Code.gs` - Complete backend handler for all forms

### 2. **API Layer**
- `src/lib/formApi.ts` - Reusable API service for form submissions
- Exports: `submitContactForm()`, `submitServiceBookingForm()`, `submitCameraRentalForm()`

### 3. **Configuration**
- `.env` - Environment variables (add your Apps Script URL here)
- `.env.example` - Template for team members
- `src/vite-env.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for env variables

### 4. **Documentation**
- `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_SETUP.md` - Complete setup instructions

## How It Works Now

### Before (Google Forms):
```
Website Form ‚Üí Google Form iframe ‚Üí Google Sheets
```
- Used hidden iframes
- No control over data processing
- Generic Google Forms UI
- Single sheet for all forms

### After (Google Apps Script):
```
Website Form ‚Üí Custom API ‚Üí Google Apps Script ‚Üí Separate Sheets + Email
```
- Direct API calls
- Full control over processing
- Custom email notifications
- Separate sheets per form type

---

## Form Separation

Each form type is now completely separated:

| Form Type | Component | API Function | Sheet Name | Email Subject |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| **Contact** | ContactSection.tsx | `submitContactForm()` | "Contact Inquiries" | "New Contact Inquiry - {name}" |
| **Service Booking** | BookingForm.tsx | `submitServiceBookingForm()` | "Service Bookings" | "New Service Booking - {service} - {name}" |
| **Camera Rental** | CameraRentalsSection.tsx | `submitCameraRentalForm()` | "Camera Rentals" | "New Camera Rental Inquiry - {name}" |

---

## Setup Required

### For Development:
1. Follow instructions in `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_SETUP.md`
2. Deploy Google Apps Script as Web App
3. Add URL to `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec
   ```
4. Restart dev server: `bun dev`

### For Production:
1. Add environment variable in your hosting platform
2. Rebuild and deploy

## Rollback Plan

2. You would need to restore from git history
3. Recommended: Keep the new implementation - it's better!
