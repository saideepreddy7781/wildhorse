## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Existing Data:
- **Old submissions** will still have the old column order
- **New submissions** (after update) will have Service first
- Consider these options:
  1. Leave old data as-is (they're already submitted)
  2. Archive old sheets and start fresh
  3. Manually reorganize old data (copy/paste columns)

### URL Stays Same:
- Your Google Apps Script URL doesn't change
- No need to update `.env` file
- No need to redeploy website
- Just redeploy the script as "new version"

### Form Data Still Works:
- Your forms send the same data
- Google Apps Script just arranges it differently in the sheet
- No changes needed to website code
- Everything will work automatically!

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### "Service still not in first column after update"
**Solution**: Make sure you:
1. Saved the new code in Apps Script (Ctrl+S)
2. Redeployed as "New version" (not just saved)
3. Waited a minute for Google to process the update
4. Tested with a NEW submission (old data won't change)

### "Getting errors in Apps Script"
**Solution**: 
1. Check that you copied the ENTIRE code from Code.gs
2. Make sure no extra characters at the beginning or end
3. Try copying and pasting again
4. Click the "Run" button on testSetup to verify

### "Old submissions still have old order"
**This is normal!** Old data keeps its structure. Only NEW submissions will have the new column order. To fix:
1. Create a new sheet tab (e.g., "Contact Inquiries - New Format")
2. Update CONFIG in Code.gs to use new sheet names
3. Old data stays in old sheets for reference
