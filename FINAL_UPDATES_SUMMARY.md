# Final Updates Summary - Wild Horse Media Website

## Date: October 21, 2025

This document summarizes all the final updates made to the Wild Horse Media website project.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Image Performance Optimization

### Changes Made:
- **Added lazy loading** to all images across the website to improve initial page load time
- Images now load progressively as users scroll down the page
- First hero image loads immediately (eager loading), while others load lazily

### Files Updated:
1. **HeroSection.tsx** - Added `loading={index === 0 ? "eager" : "lazy"}` to carousel images
2. **PortfolioSection.tsx** - Added `loading="lazy"` to all portfolio images
3. **ServicesSection.tsx** - Added `loading="lazy"` to all service card images
4. **CameraRentalsSection.tsx** - Added `loading="lazy"` to rental equipment images

### Impact:
- ‚úÖ Faster initial page load
- ‚úÖ Reduced bandwidth usage for mobile users
- ‚úÖ Better Core Web Vitals scores (LCP, CLS)
- ‚úÖ Improved user experience on slower connections

---

## 2. ‚úÖ Contact Section Layout Update

### Changes Made:
- **Reordered contact information cards** to match client requirements
- Instagram icon moved below Call icon (as shown in the image reference)

### New Order:
1. **Call Us** - +91 97409 44666
2. **Instagram** - @wildhorsemedia
3. **Email Us** - teamwildhorse@gmail.com
4. **Visit Us** - 3901, 13th main kumaraswamy layout, 2nd stage, Bangalore - 560048

### Files Updated:
- `ContactSection.tsx` - Reordered the contact cards

---

## 3. ‚úÖ Form Service Identification Enhancement

### Current Implementation:
The Google Apps Script and all forms are **already correctly configured** to track which specific service form was filled:

#### How It Works:

**Service Bookings Sheet** (for individual service pages):
- URL: `wildhorse.vercel.app/service/wedding`
- Form submits with `service: "Wedding"`
- Sheet row shows: `[Timestamp, Name, Mobile, Email, "Wedding", City, Message]`
- Each of the 12+ service pages (Wedding, Pre-wedding, Maternity, etc.) submits with its specific service name

**Contact Inquiries Sheet** (for homepage contact form):
- User manually enters their service interest
- Sheet row shows: `[Timestamp, Name, Mobile, Email, "User Input Service", City, Message]`

**Camera Rentals Sheet** (for rental form):
- Fixed service value: "Camera Rentals"
- Sheet row shows: `[Timestamp, Name, Mobile, Email, "Camera Rentals", City, Message]`

### Service Pages with Pre-filled Service Names:
1. Wedding
2. Pre-wedding
3. Engagement Ceremony
4. Bridal Photoshoot
5. Maternity
6. Baby Shower
7. Baby photoshoots
8. Family photoshoots
9. Model photoshoots
10. House Warming
11. Product & Interior
12. Album designs and printing

### Google Sheets Structure:
Each sheet has these columns (SERVICE IS NOW FIRST):
```
| Service | Timestamp | Name | Mobile | Email | City | Message |
    ‚Üë
  FIRST COLUMN - Easy to filter and sort!
```

The **Service column is now the first column**, making it super easy to:
- Sort by service type (all Weddings together, all Maternity together, etc.)
- Filter to show only specific services
- Quickly scan which service each inquiry is for
- Track which services are most popular
- Respond appropriately based on the service requested

## 4. ‚úÖ Mobile Image Aspect Ratio Fix

### Changes Made:
- **Updated Camera Rentals carousel** to use responsive aspect ratio
- Desktop: Square aspect ratio (`aspect-square`)
- Mobile: 16:9 aspect ratio (`aspect-video`)

### Implementation:
```tsx
<CardContent className="flex aspect-video md:aspect-square items-center justify-center p-0 overflow-hidden rounded-lg">
```

### Files Updated:
- `CameraRentalsSection.tsx` - Updated carousel aspect ratio

### Impact:
- ‚úÖ Consistent image display across all screen sizes
- ‚úÖ Matches the web version's 16:9 aspect ratio on mobile
- ‚úÖ Better image presentation without cropping
